## Hi, I'm Jules

I'm a computational biologist developing machine learning methods to better understand 3D chromatin stucture.

- 🔬 Computational biology intern at the Knight Cancer Instutite within OHSU
- 🧬 Bioinformatics master's candidate at the University of Oregon's Knight Campus Graduate Internship Program.
- 🖥️ Python, R, Bash, C++, Java, and SQL.
- 🧠 I’m currently learning how to apply machine learning to cancer research.

Check out some of the projects that I have been working on!
